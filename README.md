# Build a map of NYCâ€™s police precincts with React & D3, Part 1

This is the repo for part 1 of my tutorial on creating maps with React and D3, which you can read here: https://hankthemason.medium.com/build-a-map-of-nycs-police-precincts-with-react-d3-part-1-ae4b433def5c

In this tutorial, I take you through the steps of setting up a new React app, finding GeoJSON map data, and using D3 to render that data into a map in your React app.  

## Run it locally
